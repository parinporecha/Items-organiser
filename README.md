This is a simple Python script which organises your files.

Right now, all the locations are hardcoded in the script. When this is used with crontab, it automatically moves files into the respective folders specified.
I am planning to add user input for locations

Also, desktop notifications are displayed showing where each file has been placed.
Hope it makes the program user-friendly :)

The regex can be modified to include new filetypes and modify existing ones.
As I had written this a long time ago, the code is not that organised though.
Edit it and you will get a less cluttered Downloads folder or desktop or any other folder
Suggestions are welcome :)
